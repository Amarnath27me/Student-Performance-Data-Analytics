# 📊 Student Performance Data Analytics Application

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using a dataset from Kaggle. Through this notebook-based project, we explore factors affecting student grades and visualize key insights using Python data analysis and visualization libraries.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to understand the factors that influence student performance. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset, apply preprocessing techniques, and use various visualizations to uncover trends related to gender, study habits, parental education, and more.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb`: The core Jupyter notebook with data analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `Student Performance Data Analytics Application.pdf`: A PDF summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- ✅ Visual Analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- ✅ Correlation Heatmaps
- ✅ Insights on how gender, test preparation, lunch, and parental education affect performance
- ✅ Categorical and numerical feature evaluation
